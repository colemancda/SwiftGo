//: Rate Limiting
//: -------------
//:
//: _[Rate limiting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting)_
//: is an important mechanism for controlling resource
//: utilization and maintaining quality of service. SwiftGo
//: elegantly supports rate limiting with goroutines,
//: channels, and [tickers](12.%20Tickers).
//:
//: First we'll look at basic rate limiting. Suppose
//: we want to limit our handling of incoming requests.
//: We'll serve these requests off a channel of the
//: same name.
var requests = Channel<Int>(bufferSize: 5)

for i in 1 ... 5 {
    requests <- i
}

requests.close()
//: This `limiter` channel will receive a value
//: every 200 milliseconds. This is the regulator in
//: our rate limiting scheme.
let limiter = Ticker(period: 200 * millisecond)
//: By blocking on a receive from the `limiter` channel
//: before serving each request, we limit ourselves to
//: 1 request every 200 milliseconds.
for request in requests {
    <-limiter.channel
    print("request \(request) \(now)")
}

print("")
//: We may want to allow short bursts of requests in
//: our rate limiting scheme while preserving the
//: overall rate limit. We can accomplish this by
//: buffering our limiter channel. This `burstyLimiter`
//: channel will allow bursts of up to 3 events.
let burstyLimiter = Channel<Int>(bufferSize: 3)
//: Fill up the channel to represent allowed bursting.
for _ in 0 ..< 3 {
    burstyLimiter <- now
}
//: Every 200 milliseconds we'll try to add a new
//: value to `burstyLimiter`, up to its limit of 3.
go {
    for t in Ticker(period: 200).channel {
        burstyLimiter <- t
    }
}
//: Now simulate 5 more incoming requests. The first
//: 3 of these will benefit from the burst capability
//: of `burstyLimiter`.
let burstyRequests = Channel<Int>(bufferSize: 5)

for i in 1 ... 5 {
    burstyRequests <- i
}

burstyRequests.close()

for request in burstyRequests {
    <-burstyLimiter
    print("request \(request) \(now)")
}
//: Running our program we see the first batch of requests handled once every ~200 milliseconds 
//: as desired.
//:
//: For the second batch of requests we serve the first 3 immediately because of the burstable 
//: rate limiting, then serve the remaining 2 with ~200ms delays each.

//: Next example: [Stateful Goroutines](@next)
