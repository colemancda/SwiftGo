//: Timeouts
//: --------
//:
//: _Timeouts_ are important for programs that connect to
//: external resources or that otherwise need to bound
//: execution time. Implementing timeouts is easy and
//: elegant thanks to channels and `select`.
//:
//: For our example, suppose we're executing an external
//: call that returns its result on a channel `channel1`
//: after 2s.
let channel1 = Channel<String>(bufferSize: 1)

go {
    nap(now + 2 * second)
    channel1 <- "result 1"
}
//: Here's the `select` implementing a timeout.
//: `receiveFrom(channel1)` awaits the result and `timeout(now + 1* second)`
//: awaits a value to be sent after the timeout of
//: 1s. Since `select` proceeds with the first
//: receive that's ready, we'll take the timeout case
//: if the operation takes more than the allowed 1s.
select { when in
    when.receiveFrom(channel1) { result in
        print(result)
    }
    when.timeout(now + 1 * second) {
        print("timeout 1")
    }
}
//: If we allow a longer timeout of 3s, then the receive
//: from `channel2` will succeed and we'll print the result.
let channel2 = Channel<String>(bufferSize: 1)

go {
    nap(now + 2 * second)
    channel2 <- "result 2"
}

select { when in
    when.receiveFrom(channel2) { result in
        print(result)
    }
    when.timeout(now + 3 * second) {
        print("timeout 2")
    }
}
//: Running this program shows the first operation timing out and the second succeeding.
//:
//: Using this select timeout pattern requires communicating results over channels. This is a 
//: good idea in general because other important features are based on channels and select. 
//: Weâ€™ll look at two examples of this next: timers and tickers.
//:
//: Next example: [Non-Blocking Channel Operations](@next)
